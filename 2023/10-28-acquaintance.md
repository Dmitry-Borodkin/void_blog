### About the author.

Let me introduce myself: Dmitry Borodkin, 58m, professional programmer. Experience +40y...
I have been writing in C/C++ for most of my career.
For the last few years I have been working in the field of visualization of “scientific” data
(Qt/OpenGL, Ultrasonic NDT).

An unaccomplished mathematician. Passionate programming language enthusiast.
I tried a lot of what is compiled/interpreted/etc...
Experimented endlessly with my own "under-language" "under-projects"...

This continued until the fall of 2019.
Then I finally understood exactly how to get the language
and programming system that I needed...
