### About the author.

Let me introduce myself: Dmitry Borodkin, 58m, professional programmer. Experience +40y...
I have been writing in C/C++ for most of my career.
For the last few years I have been working in the field of visualization of “scientific” data
(Qt/OpenGL, Ultrasonic NDT).

An unaccomplished mathematician. Passionate programming language enthusiast.
I tried a lot of what is compiled/interpreted/etc...
Experimented endlessly with my own "under-language" "under-projects"...

This continued until the fall of 2019.
Then I finally understood exactly how to get the language
and programming system that I needed...


### About the idea.

#### Wishlist.

Here is a list of the desired properties of the language and programming system:

- The language must be low-level enough at its core that the "bare metal" can be easily accessed.
In the best traditions of the C language.

- Provide a truly limitless ability to extend the language regardless of complexity and/or common sense.
So that you can do something like this:

    - Sculpt the language C out of the blue.
    - Extend it to C++.
    - Add Borrow Checker like Rust.
    - Above this, place a thick layer of Haskell-style monads with transformers.
    - And decorate everything with JavaScript libraries on BrainF*ck...

- It is necessary to be able to create "third-party" language extensions.
So that these extensions can be included in "third-party" libraries and applications.
To make it possible to work with language the way mathematicians work
with their notation systems for their theories, proofs and other constructions.

- Etc...

This list goes on and on...
It’s easier to formulate something like this:
I need a language which extensibility would be limited only by decidability and imagination.




#### Babylonian tower of metalanguages.



#### How is this solved in natural languages?



#### Idea: separate the language from the meta-programming tool...



#### Looking for a suitable platform.



#### Decision-making...



#### Architecture sketch.
